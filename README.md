## Homework

| Homework | Description | Requirements | Deployed Codepen Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. [Obelisk](Homework/Homework%201%20-%20Obelisk) | An obelisk is rendered using geometry, faces, vertices, and can be modified using `dat.GUI` sliders. | [HW #1 Requirements](http://mr-pc.org/t/cisc3620/homework/hw1.html) | [Obelisk](https://codepen.io/MathewDavidov/pen/poJypwe) |
| 2. [Clown](Homework/Homework%202%20-%20Clown) | A clown is rendered using nested transforms of mesh created by new ``Object3D`` objects, materials, colors, and various geometries given by the ``three.js`` library such as spheres, cylinders, torus, and cones. | [HW #2 Requirements](http://mr-pc.org/t/cisc3620/homework/hw2.html) | [Clown](https://codepen.io/MathewDavidov/pen/LYVemVL) |
| 3a. [Camera (Wireframe Barn)](Homework/Homework%203%20-%20Camera/Part%201) | In previous assignments, the camera was set up by the ``TW`` library. In this assignment, the camera set-up by the student, which faces a wireframe barn. The assignment asks to adjust several camera parameters: the field of view, eye coordinates, aspect ratio, near, far, and up coordinates for a total of 5 views. | [HW #3a Requirements](http://mr-pc.org/t/cisc3620/homework/hw3.html) | [Wireframe Barn](https://codepen.io/MathewDavidov/pen/YzyKGEo) |
| 3b. [Camera (Flythrough)](Homework/Homework%203%20-%20Camera/Part%202) | (Continuation of part `a`) In this assignment, the camera set-up is done by the student on facing a house. The assignment asks to adjust several camera parameters: the field of view, eye coordinates, aspect ratio, near, far, and up coordinates for a total of 9 views. | [HW #3b Requirements](http://mr-pc.org/t/cisc3620/homework/hw3.html) | [Flythrough](https://codepen.io/MathewDavidov/pen/YzyKGYo) |
| 4. [Lit Scene](Homework/Homework%204%20-%20Lit%20Scene) | Previous assignments have used ``MeshBasicMaterial``. However, this assignment incorporates ``MeshPhongMaterial`` (double sided, single sided, specular, color, and shading) and the use of three different types of lights: ``ambient``, ``directional``, and ``spotlight`` to create a scene with a sconce that shines across a room.  | [HW #4 Requirements](http://mr-pc.org/t/cisc3620/homework/hw4.html) | [Lit Scene](https://codepen.io/MathewDavidov/pen/jObyNPa) |
| 5. [Textured Barn](Homework/Homework%205%20-%20Textured%20Barn) | This assignment uses textures, texture coordinates, ``AmbientLight``, ``DirectionalLight``, ``MeshLambertMaterial``, ``MirroredRepeatWrapping``, ``RepeatWrapping``, and ``UVMapping`` of the texture coordinates to create a barn with different modes specificied in the created ``dat.GUI``: <ul><li>``showLighting``: displays the barn without texture</li><li>``showResult``: displays the barn with a correctly mapped wooden texture</li></ul> | [HW #5 Requirements](http://mr-pc.org/t/cisc3620/homework/hw5.html) | [Textured Barn](https://codepen.io/MathewDavidov/pen/KKdyzPJ) |
| 6. [Creative Scene](Homework/Homework%206%20-%20Creative%20Scene) | In the final assignment, we are instructed to "apply several of the computer graphics concepts we have learned in the course this semester." These are the concepts used: <ol><li><b>Modeling, particularly hierarchical</b>: The basketball hoop is comprised of a pole, a pole extension, a backboard, and a rim in a hierarchal fashion.</li><li><b>Material, lighting and shading</b>: All the materials in the scene make of use of Lambert or Phong material. Ambient, directional, and spotlight lights are used throughout the scene. The ball casts a shadow on the floor through the spotlight.</li><li><b>Textures and texture-mapping</b>: The floor, walls, and basketball make use of textures.</li><li><b>User interaction</b>: A GUI is available to change deltaT, the size of the ball, and the floor texture.</li><li><b>Animation</b>: The ball is on a path using positional animation.</li></ol> | [HW #6 Requirements](http://mr-pc.org/t/cisc3620/homework/hw6.html) | [Creative Scene](https://codepen.io/MathewDavidov/pen/VwvBvwZ) |
